2. Enter an API name. API names are alpha-numeric names in Camel Case and we can not have multiple APIs with the same name. The [joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke) used below returns a joke with a punchline in the GET request.

2. You can select your request type(GET, POST, etc.) and add params and headers if any. 

3. Once added, you can test the API by hitting Send. If the API is correctly added and the endpoint works, you should be able to see a sample response as below.

4. Don't forget to click on save button on the bottom left conrne, otherwise you won't get a joke. Now you may laugh! :laughing:
