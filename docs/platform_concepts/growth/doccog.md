In this section, you can view the insights generated by the documents uploaded on the Studio section (while training the bot). Doc cog can provide analytics about the search results performance, categories of searches, etc. 

In this article, you will learn about: 
1. [Number of queries that went to document search](#ds): Number of queries answered and unanswered by document search for your bot over a period of time.
2. [User feedback](#uf): Cataloging the feedback received for search results for your bot into positive, negative and no feedback.
3. [What are your users searching for?](#us): Group of similar queries assigned under clusters.
4. [Document performance statistics](#ps): Track the relevance of documents by inspecting the performance metrics - suggestion count of the document, click through rate and percentage of positive feedback.
