## 1. User traffic

Benchmarking is done by calculating the same metric over the selected duration as well as for a similar duration before the start date. Selected duration and previous duration are then compared.
The bold line represents the metric for the current duration and the dotted line represents metrics for the previous duration.

> This is calculated for all the channels.

### 1.1 Users 
**Users**: This shows the unique number of users who conversed with the bot.
**Calculation logic**: It is the unique count of users from the list of messages exchanged on the bot. It is calculated using the [hyperloglog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) algorithm.

### 1.2 Messages 

**Messages**: This shows the total number of messages exchanged, along with the bifurcation of those exchanged with the bot and those with live agents.
**Calculation logic**: It is the sum of all the messages exchanged. The count includes user, bot, agent, and notification messages.

### 1.3 Sessions

**Sessions**: This shows the total number of sessions created by users, along with the count of bot-only sessions and sessions with both bot and live agent.
**Calculation logic**: It is the sum of all the sessions created by the user in the selected period.

#### 1.4 Session duration

**Session Duration**: Session duration is the average time for which the user has conversed with the bot. A session can be of 24 hours. For any number of interactions the user has in a 24 hours window from the start of a session, it'll be considered as one single session only. A new session is started after 24 hours.

**Calculation logic**: It is the average of the total time users conversed with the bot by the total number of sessions. This metric is captured for all the sources.

## 2. Real-time bot activity

This widget shows the real-time usage activity of the bot and which flows are being triggered by the user.

**Active Users**: The frequency of unique users is aggregated and shown in minute granularity for the last 30 minutes.

**Flow**: For every flow, the start event is pushed. The count of those start events is shown here for the last 1 hour.

> This is calculated for all the channels.

## 3. User acquisition

This widget shows the count of unique users conversing with the bot from various sources.

### 3.1 Traffic channel

The frequency of unique users messaging the bot is segregated by source, and aggregated in day-wise buckets for the selected date range.

> This is calculated for all the channels.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/i3QRF6G.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>


### 3.2 Platform / Medium

The frequency of unique users messaging the bot is segregated by the device they come from, aggregated in day-wise buckets for the selected date range.
The count may be significantly lesser compared to the number of users since other channels like WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. do not share this device data. Hence, the graph only shows users on the Yellow bot.

> This is calculated for Yellow Web & Mobile.

## 4. Users by country

This widget shows the count of unique users conversing with the bot from various countries. The top 5 countries and their percentage contributions are shown.

**How does the calculation work?**

The captured IP address of the user is translated to a standard location using the standard ip2location database. The count may be significantly less compared to the total number of users since it shows users only from the source - Yellow Web & Mobile.


> - Yellow Web & Mobile are the only channels for which an IP Address can be captured.
> - This is calculated for Yellow Web & Mobile.

## 5. User activity by time

The graph shows the user frequency for the selected period aggregated by the hour.

**How does the calculation work?**

The frequency of unique users messaging the bot is aggregated in hourly buckets for the selected range.

> This is calculated for all the channels.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T2u93Ao.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>

## 6. Users by device

This widget shows the different kinds of user devices from which the bot was accessed.

**How does the calculation work?**

The frequency of unique users messaging the bot is segregated by the device they come from and aggregated for the selected date range. Also, device details are available only for the Yellow Web & Mobile source. Other channels like WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. donâ€™t share this data.

> This is calculated for Yellow Web & Mobile.

## 7. Bot performance

This widget shows bot performance based on metrics like how accurate the bot is in terms of identifying customer intents, flow start, flow end, and drop-offs. This can be used to understand how accurately the bot is serving the user queries.

> This is calculated for all the channels.


### 7.1 Bot accuracy

Bot accuracy tells you about the percentage of user messages which are being identified by the bot with a certain amount of confidence.

**Calculation**
BA = [1 - (Unidentified user messages / Total User Messages)]*100

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2fMs9iy.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/>


### 7.2 Flow completion rate

Flow completion rate is a measure of how many customer intents are being fulfilled by the bot for every 100 intents started by the users.

**Calculation**
For every flow the user takes, the flow started and the flow completed event is being pushed. The FCR is measured as:
FCR = [(Flowy Completed Events) / (Flow Started Events)]* 100

### 7.3 Deflection Rate

The deflection rate is the % age of queries that the bot was able to resolve without having to transfer the chat to a live agent. This is a measure of self-serve enabled by the bot.

**Calculation**: For every conversation that happens on the bot, a human takeover event is pushed when the user requests for or is automatically transferred to a live agent. This metric is a count of all the sessions that do not have this human takeover event.

**Deflection rate** = (Bot sessions without agent handover / Total sessions) * 100

## 8. User feedback

This widget shows the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score given by users for the bot as well as agent sessions. Both of these scores are on a scale of 0 to 5. The graph shows a comparison of user feedback on bot session vs agent session at the day level for the selected timeframe.

## 9. Top flows visited

This widget shows the frequently triggered flows by the users and the average time users took to complete these flows.

**How does the calculation work?**

For every flow, the completion event is pushed. The count of those completed events along with the time it took to complete those events is shown here for the selected duration.

> - The detailed report can be viewed by visiting the "Funnels" section.
> - This is calculated for all the channels.
