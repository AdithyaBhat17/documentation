## 1. User traffic

Number of **Users, Messages, Sessions and Session duration** is used to identify user traffic. 
Benchmarking is done by calculating the same metric over the selected duration as well as for a similar duration before the start date. Selected duration and previous duration are then compared.
The bold line represents the metric for the current duration and the dotted line represents metrics for the previous duration.

> This is calculated for all the channels.

### 1.1 Users 
**Users**: This shows the unique number of users who conversed with the bot.

**Calculation logic**: It is the unique count of users from the list of messages exchanged on the bot. It is calculated using the [hyperloglog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) algorithm.

### 1.2 Messages 

**Messages**: This shows the total number of messages exchanged, along with the bifurcation of those exchanged with the bot and users (messages exchanged between bot and user) and live agents and users (messages exchanged between agent and user).   

**Calculation logic**: It is the sum of all the messages exchanged. The count includes user, bot, agent, and notification messages.

### 1.3 Sessions

**Sessions**: This shows the total number of sessions created by users, along with the count of bot-only sessions and sessions with both bot (sessions handled by bot only) and bot & live agent (sessions handled by both bot and agent).

**Calculation logic**: It is the sum of all the sessions created by the user in the selected period.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F008VRJ.png" alt="drawing" width="60%"/>


### 1.4 Session duration

**Session Duration**: Session duration is the average time spent by the users conversing with the bot. A session can be of 24 hours. For any number of interactions the user has in a 24 hours window from the start of a session, it'll be considered as one single session only. A new session is started after 24 hours.

**Calculation logic**: It is the average of the total time users conversed with the bot by the total number of sessions. This metric is captured for all the sources.

## 2. Real-time bot activity

This widget shows the real-time usage activity of the bot and flows which are triggered by the user.

**Active Users**: The frequency of unique users is aggregated and shown in minute granularity for the last 30 minutes.

**Flow**: For every flow, the start event is pushed. The count of those start events is shown here for the last 1 hour.

> This is calculated for all the channels.

## 3. User acquisition

This widget shows the count of unique users conversing with the bot from various sources.

### 3.1 Traffic channel

The frequency of unique users messaging the bot is segregated by source, and aggregated in day-wise buckets for the selected date range.

> This is calculated for all the channels.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/i3QRF6G.png" alt="drawing" width="50%"/>


### 3.2 Platform / Medium

The frequency of unique users messaging the bot is segregated by the device they come from, aggregated in day-wise buckets for the selected date range.
The count may be significantly lesser compared to the number of users since other channels like WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. do not share this device data. Hence, the graph only shows users on the Yellow bot.

> This is calculated for Yellow Web & Mobile.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EybHJHP.png" alt="drawing" width="60%"/>


--------

## 4. Users by country

This widget shows the count of unique users conversing with the bot from various countries. The top 5 countries and their percentage contributions are shown.

**How does the calculation work?**

The captured IP address of the user is translated to a standard location using the standard ip2location database. The count may be significantly less compared to the total number of users since it shows users only from the source - Yellow Web & Mobile.


> - Yellow Web & Mobile are the only channels for which an IP Address can be captured.
> - This is calculated for Yellow Web & Mobile.

## 7. Bot performance

This widget shows the bot's performance based on the accuracy of the bot in identifying customer intents, flow start, flow end, and drop-offs. This can be used to understand how accurately the bot is serving the user queries.

> This is calculated for all the channels.


### 7.1 Bot accuracy

Bot accuracy shows you the percentage of user messages that are identified by the bot (with a certain amount of confidence).

**Calculation**
BA = [1 - (Unidentified user messages / Total User Messages)]*100

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2fMs9iy.png" alt="drawing" width="60%"/>


### 7.2 Flow completion rate

Flow completion rate is a measure of how many customer intents are being fulfilled by the bot for every 100 intents started by the users.

**Calculation**
For every flow the user takes, the flow started and the flow completed event is being pushed. The FCR is measured as:
FCR = [(Flowy Completed Events) / (Flow Started Events)]* 100

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/c1DNijc.png" alt="drawing" width="60%"/>



### 7.3 Deflection Rate

The deflection rate is the % age of queries that the bot was able to resolve without transferring the chat to a live agent. This is a measure of self-serve enabled by the bot.

**Calculation**: For every conversation that happens on the bot, a human takeover event is pushed when the user requests for or is automatically transferred to a live agent. This metric is a count of all the sessions that do not have this human takeover event.

**Deflection rate** = (Bot sessions without agent handover / Total sessions) * 100

<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WPfVI_IJMFdrI8hsg_K7TzezDieOFbFzbh3KEXKsH9xEEU0BiU8XeKrePydcgMzGtNg61qS_YkX1dQ-VPNUp5IC4qBRmGB5pSbYiRHL5zdp6KxTJ2JoxzUoyFpSkCyF5iLkOHI6GE2byj9AtfyNyhO8mUOWrqfBJ7ugi1bmhxIeQpuhOH4Tv-oNRUEmKQw" alt="drawing" width="60%"/>

:::note
**Human takeover** rate is now replaced with **Deflection rate** because it is a better indication of the bot's performance.

## 9. Top flows visited

This widget shows the frequently triggered flows by the users and the average time users took to complete these flows.

**How does the calculation work?**

For every flow, the completion event is pushed. The count of those completed events along with the time it took to complete those events is shown here for the selected duration.

> - The detailed report can be viewed by visiting the "Funnels" section.
> - This is calculated for all the channels.

## 10. Conversation issues

These are the analytics based on the conversation logs (studio). 

> At the end of the widget, you can analyze the metrics for the selected date range. To see these conversations, click **View conversation logs**, you will be directed to the **Studio > Conversation logs** page.  
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/ALU3xMi.png)



### 10.1 Overview

This is a time-series view of the priority issues identified in your bot-user conversations.

High-level metrics tracked are:
- **Messages with issues**: This represents the percentage of messages where the above issues have been identified out of the total messages exchanged between the user and bot.
- **Users affected**: This is the percentage of total users that faced one or more of the issues while conversing with the bot.

The conversation issues identified are:

- **Missing bot response**: When an expected bot response does not go through due to a broken flow or a fallback not being configured.
- **Unidentified**: When the bot is unable to recognize the intent of a user message.
- **Validator limit exceeded**: When the validation of a particular user message fails more than 3 times consecutively.
- **Fallback limit exceeded**: When the fallback journey is called more than two times in a row due to the bot not understanding user intent.

### 10.2 Analyse

Select the **Analyse** tab to see a detailed view of conversation issues along with their severity and count of total occurrences. 
Four common issues encountered by the bot (**unidentified user response, missing bot response, validation limit exceeded, fallback limit exceeded**) are listed along with the **Suggested next steps**. 

You can click on each issue to get redirected to the conversation logs where those issues have been identified. These conversations are filtered for the selected parameters, that is, applied date range and tag (identified issue). 

![](https://i.imgur.com/KHHIq3A.png)

#### Steps to identify and fix conversation issues

> Consider the following example to fix the **Missing bot response** issue. 

**Missing bot response** can be rectified by opening the conversations, finding the point where the bot response was missing, and configuring a fallback or adding a message to the node, if empty.

1. Click **Missing bot response**. You will be directed to the conversation log page that consists of the conversations that encountered missing bot responses. 
2. Open any conversation. Select the **Missing bot response** to identify the exact point. 
3. Hover over the text, click on the menu options, and select **Go to node**. 
4. You will be directed to the respective flow, modify the flow by adding a fallback/new message as per your use case.
