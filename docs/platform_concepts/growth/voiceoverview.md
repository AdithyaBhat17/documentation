An analytics dashboard in **Insights** is built specifically for voice bots, it is found under - **Voice Overview**. Voice bots are built on the IVR channel and hence, telephony metrics are very critical while understanding overall voice bot performance like call statuses, average call duration, user traffic, etc. (along with the bot engagement metrics that are already available on **Insights**). The  **Voice Overview** section has all current and historical data classified under: 
1. [User traffic](#1)
2. [Call status](#2)
