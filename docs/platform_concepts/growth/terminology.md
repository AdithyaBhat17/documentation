## User Journey Visualisation


1. ***Session start***: This is the start of the flow chart. All the data shown in journey visualisation flow charts is on a session ID level. If one person comes to the bot 3 times in 3 days, we look at all the 3 paths he/she took. 
2. ***User Dropped*** : This means the user got dropped off the chat window or did not respond for a very long time.
3. ***Journey completion rate***: Total times a journey was triggered/ total times it was completed.
4. ***Journey dropped rate***: %age of times users dropped off the chat.
5. ***Journey switched rate***: %age of time users switched paths between two journeys
6. ***43.28 %(***96310): This means, out of 100% of the sessions which got triggered on the chat, 43.28 % (~ 96310) times people went to the wallet journey directly after starting the session.
    - This does not mean 96310 users went through this flow. 
    - This also does not mean that only 96310 times the wallet journey was triggered. 
    - The journey was triggered 96310 times directly after starting the session. This does not include the numbers for cases     where this journey was triggered in a later stage.
    
    
## ***‘Steps inside the journey’*** model


1. ***Journey Switched***: This means the user switched from journey A to journey B.
2. ***Journey Completed***: This denotes completion of the journey. It might take longer for certain users to complete the journey based on the steps in the journey and their response to it.
3. ***User Dropped***: This means the user got dropped off the chat window or did not respond for a very long time.
