The platform supports Speech-to-Text (STT) feature for chatbots to convert spoken words into text. This allows the chatbot to recognize the spoken language of the user and respond to their queries in the form of text. 

STT helps users save time by not having to type their messages. Based on the user's spoken words, the chatbot interprets the user’s intent accurately compared to text based messages.

:::note
* To enable SST for your chatbots, contact support@yellow.ai.
* The supported languages for STT are English, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, and Slovak.
