For detailed instructions, see [Facebook's documentation](https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/1275400645914358?id=725943027795860)
:::

Once the Catalog is created, you can go to the Commerce Manager available on the top right and manage your Catalog from the Commerce Manager Dashboard.

You can add products to the Catalog either manually or through [Data Feed](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1898524300466211?id=725943027795860). 

An ideal way to manage your products is through Data Feed as it allows adding products with complete information using a CSV file, and sync the data through the Commerce Manager (CM). 

You can automate the sync on your preferred cadence such as Hourly, Daily etc. To find the CSV headers and supported values on the Data Feed, see [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/120325381656392?id=725943027795860).


![](https://i.imgur.com/fL3D0n7.png)


It is important to note the following points in Catalog before using its products.

1. ContentID can be given from the Business side or will get generated automatically from FB side. This id needs to be unique and will be used as Product ID in the WhatsApp product msg node.
2. It takes some time to update products when syncing the catalogs using the data feed. You cannot send products on WhatsApp until this process is completed.
3. For Businesses in India, it is mandatory to have these fields (origin_country, importer_name, and importer_address) filled in as per field specification bfor each product to be used as SPM/MPM. 
4. You can add the field values (origin_country, importer_name, and importer_address) in the CSV file or use Data Rule to fill the values by default from the Data Feed settings page.
