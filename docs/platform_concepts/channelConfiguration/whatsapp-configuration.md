### 2.1 Commerce manager (Catalog)

The Facebook Commerce manager helps in listing the products to be used for SPM/MPM. It is not possible to send any product on WhatsApp without listing the products on FB Commerce Manager.


:::note

:::


To create a Catalog in FB Commerce Manager for your Business - 

1. Log on to [Facebook Business Manager](https://business.facebook.com/settings) and go to Business Settings. Use the client's BM to create Production Catalogs.
2. Navigate to **Data Sources** and click on **Catalog**.

After the Catalog is created you can go to the Commerce Manager available on the top right and manage your Catalog from the Commerce Manager Dashboard.

You can add products to the Catalog either manually or by using a [Data Feed](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1898524300466211?id=725943027795860). Data Feed is the ideal way to manage your products as it allows adding products with complete information through a CSV file and sync it with the Commerce Manager (CM). The sync can be automated on required cadence such as Hourly, Daily etc. You can find the CSV Headers and supported values on the Data Feed [here](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/120325381656392?id=725943027795860).


![](https://secure-res.craft.do/v2/L4WM1z6kJj18seBUUw2MuARGoGtYBZnsDbGiZ3oGKryUqPeWhxw6C4pK8vL23CmUiucQdeLh1YfYgmFg9TUaAhenEm6BPkxe7hedEtKwgZsKhiQfwNq9FEYvnMqZ96dCER56Nt13CzPmyRQJxCFRLsHNBuyu4D7azv7G1dxEowZ9xkhDt2v8U6rLPHiU1UdfJNMdykSfDimCXqZQbiDwKzDUSo4LHrBrq75pRv3jJViQrTF2SVxwLsSbbRPPsziakcfqCJ7tHguZWkJ6fntfTBcGDC5ssh6oiF5J5PkLEBz9sSgLoC/Image.jpg)



It is important to note the few points in Catalog before using the Products.

1. ContentID can be given from the Business side or will get generated automatically from FB side. This id needs to be unique and will be used as Product ID in the WhatsApp product msg node.
2. While syncing the catalogs using a data feed it takes some amount of time to get updated during which the products might not be available to be sent on the WhatsApp.
3. For Businesses in India its mandatory to have these field filled as per field specification for each product to be used as SPM/MPM. origin_country, importer_name, importer_address
4. The above fields can be filled up in the CSV or can also be added a Data Rule to be filled by default from the Data Feed settings page.
