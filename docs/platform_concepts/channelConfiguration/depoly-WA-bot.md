Let's say that you have built a bot for the WhatsApp channel and now want to deploy it on your website or mobile application using a chat widget. This document will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to port your WhatsApp bot to your website or mobile application using a chat widget.

:::note
* You can use the V2 widget using the bot script from the cloud.yellow.aiÂ platform even if the bot code is in the app platform.
* You can use Mobile SDKs for deploying WhatsApp bot on [iOS](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/mobile/chatbot/ios) and [Android](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/mobile/chatbot/android) apps.

To deploy an existing WhatsApp bot on a website or mobile application, follow these steps:

1. To create a separate flow using the WhatsApp specific components such as WhatsApp quick reply and list card.
2. Use the provided code snippet in the [function](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/build/code) while creating the flows based on your use case:

// actions or message list which you want to display
}
if(app.source == "yellowmessenger"){
// actions or the quick replies which you want to display.
}
```
