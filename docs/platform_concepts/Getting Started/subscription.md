### What is Subscription? 
A default subscription with basic plan (T0) is created for every new user signing up on the cloud.yellow.ai platform. 

For new users, we give 30 days of free trial where users can sign up and create a bot and explore the platform and post the free trial users can reach out to sales@yellow.ai to upgrade their account and continue using the platform. 

For yellow.ai employees signing up on cloud.yellow.ai for the first time, can create their own subscription or is provided a training subscription where they can create a bot and explore the platform.

### Number of bots per subscription

Initially all subscriptions are allowed to create a single bot but if needed we can upgrade the account to create more bots within the same subscription, Please reach out to sales@yellow.ai for more details. 

Subscription is used by the account team to maintain billing details, users can have more than one subscription but its suggested that one company or organisation creates only one subscription and gets it upgraded via sales if required.
