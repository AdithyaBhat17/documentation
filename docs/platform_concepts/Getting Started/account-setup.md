## 3. Subscription

A default subscription with basic plan (T0) is created for every new user signing up on the cloud.yellow.ai platform. 

For yellow.ai employees signing up on cloud.yellow.ai for the first time, can create their own subscription or is provided a training subscription where they can create a bot and explore the platform.

### Number of bots per subscription

Initially all subscriptions are allowed to create a single bot but if needed, we can upgrade the account to create more bots within the same subscription. Please reach out to sales@yellow.ai for more details. 

Subscription is used by the account team to maintain billing details, users can have more than one subscription but its suggested that one company or organisation creates only one subscription and gets it upgraded via sales if required.

### Manage Subscription
Whenever another platform user [shares bot access](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/Getting%20Started/add-bot-collaborators) with you to collaborate, you have to first accept the invite and then switch to their subscription to access their bot.


1. To switch your subscription, go to your **Profile** and click on **Billing**.
