## Scope of Integration

Yellow.ai Integration with Google Calendar enables you to seamlessly access google calendar services. Any customer who has a google account will be able to connect with yellow.ai using OAuth. Using this integration you can create, read events and also you can search for the busy time slots of the person and this can help you to create events according to it.

## Use-cases

Following are the use-cases which are currently accommodated in the Integration:

### Simple integration with Oauth

Google calendar integration with yellow.ai happens through the Oauth 2.0 approach.
While integrating, yellow.ai navigates the user to the login page of Google, user has to login into his google account and has to provide his consent to access his calendar data.

### Do actions with google calendar action nodes

You can create a new calendar event by specifying the timings, event title, description etc.. You can check the time slots of the person where you get busy time slots of the person and can create the event accordingly.

You can also read the calendar event with the event id to get the updates of that event.
