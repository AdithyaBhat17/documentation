## 1. Scope of Integration
Yellow.ai Integration with Zoho CRM allows you to seamlessly connect your Zoho CRM instance with yellow.ai platform. Any customer having a Zoho CRM account can connect their Zoho instance with yellow.ai using OAuth. This connector is used to perform actions on your leads. This integration can be used to create, update, read leads and search for leads with email and phone number.

> **Supported Version**
This integration will work on versions 2.0 and above. 

## 2. Use-cases
Following are the use-cases which are currently accommodated in the Integration:
### 2.1 Simple integration with Oauth

Yellow.ai does not store the client’s credentials and leverages oAuth 2.0 approach for integrating with client’s Zoho account.
While integrating, yellow.ai navigates you to login into the Zoho CRM account and request for the consent to access it on yellow.
