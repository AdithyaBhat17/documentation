## Scope of Integration

Yellow.ai Integration with Salesforce CRM allows you to seamlessly connect your Salesforce CRM instance with yellow.ai platform.

This connector will enable users to receive events for Salesforce objects, both system defined and custom objects. Furthermore, this connector with enable you to take actions, such as create, update etc. on the objects


## Use-cases

Following are the use-cases which are currently accommodated in the Integration:

### Simple Integration with oAuth 2.0

Yellow.ai does not store the client’s credentials and leverages oAuth 2.0 approach for integrating with client’s Salesforce account.

While integrating, yellow.ai navigates the user to the login page of Salesforce, i.e. login.salesforce.com or to the subdomain which was already used in the same browser. If you want to integrate in some other instance, clear your cookies and retry login in from yellow.ai platform.

### Take actions with Salesforce Nodes

You can store a new record or store data in any of your custom objects. The actions are not limited to the system defined Salesforce Objects, you can even use your Custom Objects here. The functionalities to update and search for records using a particular parameter is also available.
