## Scope of Integration

Yellow.ai Integration with Salesforce CRM allows you to seamlessly connect your Salesforce CRM instance with yellow.ai platform. Any customer who has a Salesforce CRM account will be able to seamlessly connect their Salesforce instance with yellow.ai using oAuth. This connector will enable users to receive events for Salesforce objects, both system defined and custom objects. Furthermore, this connector with enable you to take actions, such as create, update etc. on the objects


## Use-cases

Following are the use-cases which are currently accommodated in the Integration:

### Simple Integration with oAuth 2.0

Yellow.ai does not store the client’s credentials and leverages oAuth 2.0 approach for integrating with client’s Salesforce account.

While integrating, yellow.ai navigates the user to the login page of Salesforce, i.e. login.salesforce.com or to the subdomain which was already used in the same browser. If you want to integrate in some other instance, clear your cookies and retry login in from yellow.ai platform.

### Take actions with Salesforce Nodes

You can store a new**Lead(Object)** or store data in any of your custom objects. The actions are not limited to the system defined Salesforce Objects, you can even use your Custom Objects here. The actions are not just limited to creating a new record in the object, you can read, update and delete relevant records too from the objects.
