**To retrieve API Domain**

1. Login to your **Freshchat** portal as an administrator.
2. Go to **Admin Settings** > **Channels** > **Mobile SDK**.

The following are the domain URLs of data centres on different regions:
1. .in - https://api.in.freshchat.com/v2 
2. .eu - https://api.eu.freshchat.com/v2 
3. .au - https://api.au.freshchat.com/v2 and if the domain value is just msdk.freshchat.com, then it belongs to USA data center and hence the value that needs to be configured is https://api.freshchat.com/v2


### 1.2 Enable the integration in Yellow.ai's Integration module
