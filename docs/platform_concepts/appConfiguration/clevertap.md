The CleverTap integration allows you to create templates on yellow and run campaigns for your user base directly on CleverTap.

## 1. Integration
1. Navigate to **Marketplace** and search for CleverTap under **All integrations**.

2. Generate and copy the API key and paste it with in the Authorization header over on CleverTap. 
3. Enable Postback URL from Preferences within Engage. To know how to enable this from Preferences, see [Notification Engine](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/notification-engine/#postback-webhook--url).
4. Paste the callback URL generated by CleverTap in the fields shown on the integrations page.

## 2. Templates
You can generate regular templates through the [Template creation module](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/outbound/templates/overview). You can use these template names directly in CleverTap.

To dynamically change text within a template, you can make use of **Freeform templates**.

### 2.1 Freeform templates

These help you pass dynamic text over on CleverTap. For this, you need to generate two separate templates - 
1. **Freeform Text template**
This is a template with just a variable {{1}} passed into the template. Once approved, you can pass that template as a field within the Integrations page.

2. **Freeform media template**
This follows the same behaviour as the text template but with a media file attached at the time of approval. This media can be dynamically changed over on CleverTap.

Once the templates have been approved, pass both of these template names into the integration page fields.

## 3. Limitations
The CleverTap integration does not support the following: 
1. The text in a header cannot be dynamically changed.
2. Media formats supported within the header are png, jpg and mp4.
3. Error codes in callbacks from the WA server.
4. Dynamic quick replies.
