## Scope of Integration

Yellow.ai Integration with Genesys Live Chat allows you to seamlessly connect your genesys service with the yellow.ai platform.

**Note**: We recommend this integration if you are using genesys on-prem solution otherwise you should use [genesys PureCloud](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/appConfiguration/genesys-cloud-livechat) integration as that would be the latest version from genesys



## Configuration

Inside your project, navigate to the Integrations tab and on the left side bar select **Live Chat**. You will find Genesys Live Chat.

You have to provide your genesys host and service name below to connect you genesys account with yellow.ai bot.
