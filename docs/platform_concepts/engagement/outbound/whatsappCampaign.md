## What is a WhatsApp notification campaign?

WhatsApp is known for its stellar nessage notification open rates. Brands can plan their customer outrech and communication around WhatsApp.

## Let's get started

First things first, before starting to run WhatsApp campaigns on our platfrom, you'll have to [get your WhatsApp account approved from Facebook](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/whatsapp-configuration). And, connect the account with the Yellow AI's platfrom.

Once you successfully complete the process, we can start with WhatsApp campaigns.

**Step 1:**

Navigate to your project and go to 'Engage' module.

WhatsApp ensures each notification message template that you send to your customers are of top quality, transactional, updates and not promotional.

To ensure the same, you have to craft your template and get it approved from WhatsApp.

Now, let's start creating a **new template**.

**Step 6:**

You'll end up in this screen.

You can check the list of templates and their statuses (approved, pending, rejected) under **My templates**.

If you have none, **Create New Segement** and proceed.

**Step 9:**

Wow! You've reached the imporant step.

You can schedule WhatsApp campaigns in multiple ways - **run now or at a later date**, **run once or recurring daily, weekly, or monthly based on your campaign's purpose**.

For our example, since we've taken monthly payment reminders, you can find in the image below that the campaign is scheduled monthly at a fixed date and time.
