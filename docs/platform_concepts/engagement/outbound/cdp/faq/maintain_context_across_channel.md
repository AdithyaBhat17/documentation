title: How to Unify Profiles and Maintain Context across Channels?
---

To achieve true personalisation, you might want to recognise your users on every channel they appear on. To achieve this:

- Decide what your [user identifier](../enriching_user_profiles/user_id) will be
- You need to start [identifying users](../enriching_user_profiles/builder_capture_data#what-are-identified-users) on every channel
- Once the user is identified, [capture as much conversational data](/enriching_user_profiles/builder_capture_data) as you can
- Utilise the above data, captured on one channel, to [deliver personalised engagement](../user_data/conv_in_builder) on another channel
