## What is CDP?

CDP stands for **Customer Data Platform** which helps you with following things:

- Collect user data from bot conversations and client’s external tech stack
- Unify user profiles and maintain context across channels
- Segment users into meaningful audiences, and
- Activate user data and segments in various modules of yellow.ai to drive personalisation


:::info
CDP is enabled by default for bots created after 1st June 2022.

Write to sarthak@yellow.ai to get it enabled for your bot.

## Getting Started with the yellow.ai's Users Module 
User’s Module is available in the Engage section of your app. This is where you can see who your users are and manage them, define user properties, create user segments and more.

**NOTE:** This is enabled only for cloud.yellow.ai

### Step 1: Customise the schema to be about your users

It’s import to gather data that’s specific to your Users. While there are a couple of Default User Properties in the schema, called [System Properties](./cdp_data#system-user-properties), you can also create and send [Custom Properties](./cdp_data#custom-user-properties) and [Events](./cdp_data#user-events).

While User Properties store data about who your users are, events tell you when users take important actions in your product.

### Step 2: Import your users

You might want to have some user data to begin with, in order to create personalised engagements. You can import users directly from a CSV or by using REST APIs.
If you don’t have any data to being with, do not worry, our platform can help you create and enrich conversation based user data.

### Step 3: Create segments to power personalisation

By combining the user data with Properties and Events, you can create highly focussed segments. These segments update automatically as users match the criteria set by you.
