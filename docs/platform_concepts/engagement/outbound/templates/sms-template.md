Note: If you are going to send SMS outbound to India, all the details you add here should be as exact as you added in the DLT portal. Even if there is a slightest change in any of the details or template body,

Note: For some countries, some details like entity ID and template ID will be irrelevant. In such cases, you can only add the Sender ID and template message you want to send.

Note: If you want to have dynamic values such as verification code, payment links, first names etc for each of the recipient phone number, you can create variables inside the content .

To create a new variable, use the structure {{*variable_name_comes_here*}} - ie, the variable name between double curly brackets.

**Step 5:**

Once you are good with the template created, **Save** the template.
