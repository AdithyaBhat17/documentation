## In this guide

This guide shows you how to **manage** your campaigns, **duplicate** them, **prioritise** them and monitor their **performance metrics**.

### Managing your Campaigns using Campaign Actions

You can use **Campaigns Action**s for a single campaign, or for bulk campaigns, as shown in the GIF below.

A campaign **Status** can be the following:

- **Active →** This campaign has been successfully created and would be triggered if the conditions are met
- **Inactive →** This campaign has been successfully created, however, it won’t be triggered if the conditions are met
- **Draft →** This campaign has not yet been successfully created and is incomplete. You can choose to edit it anytime to complete the campaign setup

You will have various **Campaign Actions** to choose from:

- **Deactivate/Activate →** This action deactivates an active campaign, and activates an inactive one
- **Archive →** This action “deletes” a campaign
- **Duplicate** → This action creates a duplicate of that specific campaign. The newly created duplicate will have the lowest priority(more on priority later) and will also have “-duplicate” suffixed to it’s name
- **Edit →** This action takes you back to the campaign setup journey, and you can use this to make changes to an existing campaign

### Campaign Performance Metrics

To know how your campaigns are performing, click on the campaign name.

This is what each of the metrics mean:

1. **Widget Impressions →** This is the no. of times the Widget is loaded. (n/a for “Chat Auto Popup Widget“)
2. **Widget Conversions →** This is % of times the button is clicked. (n/a for “Chat Auto Popup Widget“)
3. **Chat Impressions →** This is the no. of times the **Chat Widget** is loaded.
4. **Chat Conversions →** This is the % of times the user responds on the **Chat Widget** by sending a message.


### Campaign Prioritisation

Campaign prioritisation ensures that no two campaigns are triggered at the exact same instant.

Any new campaign created, will be auto-assigned the lowest priority, ie, the highest “priority number”. No two campaigns can ever have the same “priority number”.

**NOTE:** When a duplicate is created, since it is a new campaign, it will also be assigned the lowest priority, ie, the highest “priority number”.

Re-prioritisation of your campaigns is really easy, and the **PRIORITY** column comes in handy here.

Click on the “priority number” of any campaign and change it to a new priority. You’ll notice the campaigns will get re-arranged based on the newly assigned priorities.
