## User identification journey

<details>

<summary>Can I change userId frequently?</summary>

You cannot update a userId once captured. If you try to capture a new userId in the same session, a new record is created with that specific identifier. For more details, see [What happens when the userId is recaptured](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/data_capture_convers#what-happens-when-the-userid-is-recaptured).

<summary>How can I update existing user properties?</summary>

You can update existing user properties by identifying the user and recapturing the user properties that you would like to update. However, you cannot update the userId.
