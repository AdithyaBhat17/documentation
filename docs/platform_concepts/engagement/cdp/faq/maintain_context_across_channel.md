title: How to Unify Profiles and Maintain Context across Channels?

To achieve true personalisation, you might want to recognise your users on every channel they appear on. To achieve this:

- Decide what your [user identifier](/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/user_properties#13-user-id-userid-as-a-property) will be
- You need to start [identifying users](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/enriching_user_profiles/builder_capture_data#2-what-are-identified-users) on every channel
- Once the user is identified, [capture as much conversational data](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/enriching_user_profiles/builder_capture_data) as you can
- Utilise the above data, captured on one channel, to [deliver personalised engagement](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data/conv_in_builder) on another channel
