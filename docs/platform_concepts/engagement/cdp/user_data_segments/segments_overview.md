## Introduction 
A user segment is a grouping of users based on common characteristics. You can define conditions to create static segments, which remain fixed over time, and dynamic segments that automatically update based on user data.

For example, you can create static segments for users interested in a particular product, visitors to your pricing page, or users in a specific department. Dynamic segments can be formed based on conditions like users whose age group is between 20-30 or those who have recently made a purchase.

Segmenting your user base is highly recommended as it allows you to filter and send targeted messages to specific groups. For instance, you can create a static segment for trial users and a dynamic segment for users who have made a purchase in the last 30 days. This enables you to send personalized onboarding messages to trial users and follow-up messages to recent purchasers.

By utilizing both static and dynamic segments, you can effectively tailor your communication to different user groups and improve the overall user experience.
