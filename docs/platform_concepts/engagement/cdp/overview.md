## Getting Started with the yellow.ai's Users Module 
User’s Module is available in the Engage section of your app. This is where you can see who your users are and manage them, define user properties, create user segments and more.

This is enabled only for https://cloud.yellow.ai

### Step 1: Customise the schema to be about your users

It’s import to gather data that’s specific to your Users. While there are a couple of Default User Properties in the schema, called [System Properties](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/cdp_data#system-user-properties), you can also create and send [Custom Properties](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/cdp_data#custom-user-properties) and [Events](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/cdp_data#user-events).

While User Properties store data about who your users are, events tell you when users take important actions in your product.

### Step 2: Import your users

You might want to have some user data to begin with, in order to create personalised engagements. You can import users directly [from a CSV](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/enriching_user_profiles/create_audience_group_csv) or by using [REST APIs](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/enriching_user_profiles/send_user_data_event_rest_api).

If you don’t have any data to being with, do not worry, our platform can help you create and [enrich conversation based user data](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/enriching_user_profiles/builder_capture_data).

### Step 3: Create segments to power personalisation

By combining the user data with Properties and Events, you can [create highly focussed segments](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/creating_managing_user_segment). These segments update automatically as users match the criteria set by you.
