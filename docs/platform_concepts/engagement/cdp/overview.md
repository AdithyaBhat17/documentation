The following are the key actions that you can perform on user 360.

### 1.1 Add users

The platform provides different ways to add your users. You can add each user manually or leverage advanced features  to quickly create your user base and maintain it real-time.  
* Import users directly [from a CSV](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/enriching_user_profiles/create_audience_group_csv) 
* Use our [REST APIs](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/enriching_user_profiles/send_user_data_event_rest_api) to add or modify users real-time.

  * Use [Bot Builder to create and update users](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/enriching_user_profiles/builder_capture_data/#3-using-builder-to-create--update-user-records-in-users-table)


### 1.2 Enrich your user data

It is important to collect data that is specific to your users. While there are some predefined properties, called [System Properties](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/cdp_data#system-user-properties), you can also create and send [Custom properties](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/cdp_data#custom-user-properties) and [Events](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/cdp_data#user-events).

 
User properties store data about who your users are, events tell you when users take important actions on your product.


### 1.3 Create segments to power personalisation

 

By combining the user data with Properties and Events, you can [create highly focussed segments](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/engagement/cdp/user_data_segments/creating_managing_user_segment). These segments update automatically as and when users match the criteria that you set.
