In Yellow.ai, each user is an individual. This process of adding or updating user data is more dynamic. With APIs, you can ensure that all your user-related data on Yellow.ai is always in sync with your entire tech stack.

You can use [User Management APIs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/17583548/UVsEVUsg) to Create, Read, Update and Delete your user data.
