 Follow The below steps.
* Identify right audience.

## Identify the right audience:
While creating any campign it is imperative to identify the right set of audience. Sending messages to **Uninterested audience** might lead to **low quality rating** for your connected whatsapp number when they **block your number**.
* You can add the audience by going into engagemnt-> users->add user. You can also upload a CSV file.
* Make sure to **add correct country code**, otherwise whatsApp will try to send the message to a user by appending the country code of your business phone number.
* Use **tags** to bifurcate users into different segments.

* **User opt-in** - Always ask for user opt-in while sending  message to a new/old customer. You can do this while creating your template. Few examples of how companies use opt-in/opt-out to make sure their quality ratings remain intact.

## Setup Goals and objectives

Without setting up clear goals, you are basically **directionless**- and working to achieve **vanity metrics** that won't help you achieve your overall business objective.

**For example**- Without social media objectives you are basically working to get more likes and engagement- but does that necessarily translate to success? 

On the other hand, if your goal is to convert more followers- then don't focus upon getting more likes and comments. Instead try to drive more social media traffic to your website and encourage the traffic  down the marketing funnel.

**Setting up Goals** -
Setting objectives works best through SMART goals, they cover every aspect of campaign goal.
* **Specific**- Be very specific about your goal and make sure it has a clear objective.
* **Measurable**- What KPIs will help you determine whether you have reached your goal or not.
* **Achievable** - It is good to aim high but at the same time be prudent enough to set achievable goals.
* **Relevant**- How does your engage campaign goals help you achieve your overall business goal ?
* **Time-bound**- Giving your objectives clear deadline tells you when you need to measure the results and benchmark these results against past ( and future) campaigns.

Few examples of goals that you can set - 
* Generate more quality leads.
* Improve conversion rate.
* Increase Sales.
* Increase Traffic.
* Increase Engagement.
* Educate customer on product offerings.


## Identify the message to be conveyed
Starting with **What, Who & Why ?**

 **What?** You should revisit the company's goal and objectives outlined in the previous step to confirm the outcomes messaging is designed to achieve.

**Who ?** Confirm the audience for the messaging as mentioned in the first step ( Identify the right audience)

**Why?** Identify key words and ideas that you want to be associated with your organization, product offerings and services. You need to use these keywords prominently in your messagin to help you standout and differentiate from competition.

**Whatsapp as a Channel**

Whatsapp has mandated template approval to curb marketing spams. Promotional marketing is restricted, the primary focus being providing customer support and lifecycle updates to customer.

* We recommend to restrict whatsapp campaigns to *conveying account updates,payment updates, appointment updates,personal finance updates, reservation updates,shipping updates and providing issue resolution*.
* Message templates that contain any of the following are at a risk of getting rejected.
    * Discount, promotions, product recommendations or offers.
    * Surveys, product/service reviews and rating requests.
    * Large media ( images/gifs/videos).

## Monitoring and analysis

Once you have executed your campaign you need to analyse the results of the campaign. You can do it in 3 ways-
1. Go to the outbound/inbound page and you will get a brief summary of the campaigns that you have triggered/scheduled.
