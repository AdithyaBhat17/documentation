- There are two roles to access the inbox module, **Inbox Admin** and **Inbox Agent**
- Incoming tickets (from the bot user) are assigned to the support agents.
- Admin can add support agents and Agent can accept an invite sent by an admin to join as a support agent.
- Support agents will have access to the chats/tickets/analytics/performance to help understand and resolve queries in Inbox (other modules such as Studio, Channels, etc. will not be visible to the inbox admin/agent).
