Can we have primary and secondary WhatsApp numbers(2 phone numbers) connecting a bot user to the live agents? </summary>
<div>
Each bot has only one inbox, the bot can have multiple Whatsapp numbers activated, and the agent queries will be directed to the bot's Inbox. Hence, all Whatsapp numbers are sourced to the same Inbox module, and agents can pick up conversations(tickets) from any of the numbers.

WhatsApp templates created with <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing">hsm</a>  object will not be displayed with the actual content inside Inbox.
