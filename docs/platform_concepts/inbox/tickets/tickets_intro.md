3. This page will contain the list of all the tickets under different view (and their count). 
    - **My tickets**: List of tickets assigned to a particular agent.
    - **Collaborating tickets**: List of tickets where multiple agents have been assigned/working on a ticket.
    - **Unassigned tickets**: This list displays the tickets which are not yet assigned to any agent.
    - **Resolved tickets**: Tickets that have been resolved.
    
4. Each ticket contains the subject of the email under which you can find the requestor's name and the created date. You can also see the priority, status, agent name, and the group to which the agent belongs.
5. Each ticket is auto-assigned with a number when created, which will be its respective ticket ID.


6. Last modified date is considered as the date & time when the ticket was recently modified/updated. By default, tickets are arranged based on the last modified date with their corresponding ticket ID. You can sort by **Last modified date**.
