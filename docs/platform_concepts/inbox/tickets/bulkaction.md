In this article, you will learn: 
1. [How to change the status of multiple tickets and assign them to a group/agent?](#1)
2. [How to merge multiple tickets into one ticket?](#2)


An Inbox agent's daily operations may involve performing the same task multiple times. For example, transferring a certain number of tickets to another agent or changing the status of multiple tickets.
To simplify the repetitive tasks performed by agents, bulk actions can be used by selecting multiple tickets and performing a common action on them. 
Tickets can be merged into one ticket and assigned to one agent. Merging tickets can avoid providing the same replies to multiple tickets, when multiple tickets are combined, the same response can be sent to all the customers. 

:::note
Not more than 20 tickets can be selected at once for any of the bulk actions.

2. You can choose a ticket to be a primary ticket. For example, there are 2 tickets - one is to find a resolution for the case - 'Order received was not the order placed' and the second is to -'Provide refund for the order mismatch'. These 2 tickets can be merged into one and the agent can inform the customer that the pickup has been initiated to provide the correct product and the refund will be given only after canceling the order.  

3. If you choose **Add secondary recipients to CC**, all the other ticket's email addresses will be copied to the primary ticket. Any communication further will be CC'd to those email IDs.
