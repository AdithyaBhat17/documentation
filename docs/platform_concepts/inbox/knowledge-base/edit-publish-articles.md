When creating an article, multiple updates and reviews must be done before you publish it. Here's how you can effectively manage i.e edit & publish articles in the knowledge base.

:::note
Only **Admin, Inbox Admin & Inbox Supervisor** can create, read, update and delete content in the knowledge base. 
**Inbox Agents** can only read articles
:::
  
## 1. Publish an article

- Every newly created article is in "Draft" status by default. When an article is under draft status it will not be visible to the agents or your end-users.

- You can save the article temporarily and keep on making changes until it is ready to go live.

- Once you are sure that the article can be published, click **Publish** in the top right corner.

- Select the visibility & the language of the article's content to publish the article.

- Add relevant tags to the article.

	- Tags are effectively used to group & organise content across your knowledge base. It helps readers find what they are looking for. They also provide data about your page to search engines and website visitors.

- Visibility defines to which persona the article is visible to:

	- **Internal** - Only visible to your team i.e agents & admins. Not visible to the end-users.

	- **External** - Visible to both your end-users and your team.

- Click **Edit** to update the content of the article.

- Properties like Article details and SEO settings in the right side section can be edited independently of the article content.

- Clicking on Edit in an already published article, will create a draft version with the same content. This version is independent of the published version that is still live & visible to the end users (If you don't want an article to be visible to the end users, you can either un-publish it or delete the article).

	- Now the same article has both **draft** and **published** versions of the article.

- Continue making changes to the draft version and save the article whenever necessary.

- Once you are confident about taking the article live, click **Publish draft** button.

- An article can at most have 1 published version & 1 draft version at a time.

- When you are opening an article that has both published & draft versions, by default **draft** version would be visible.

- If you want to delete the draft version but not the of an article, click the **discard** draft button inside the article.

- Click on the three-dot icon and select **Unpublish**.

- This article will now be removed from the customer-facing portal and saved as a draft version so that you can make revisions on top of it.

- If you want the article to be permanently removed from the KB, you should delete it.

- When an article has both a draft & published version, you cannot unpublish it directly. You would've either discard the current draft or publish it directly.
