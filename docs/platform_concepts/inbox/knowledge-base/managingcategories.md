The knowledge base is another medium to automate the incoming support queries by making it easier for the customers to find information about their issues which in turn reduces the number of tickets raised for the support agent
Knowledge bases are designed in a way to make customers find information easily without needing help. Hence the knowledge base has to be structured in a well defined & intuitive manner.

Inbox's knowledge base hierarchy is as follows;

> Categories > Folders > Articles

Categories basically cover the broad theme of your product or service. Taking an e-commerce company as an example, Payments, Shipping & Delivery etc., would be the major categories. Folders are a group of articles that explain a subset within that category. For eg, Refunds, Policies within Payments.

- Payments

	- Refunds

	- Payment issues

	- Unknown charges

- Shipping & Delivery

	- Large & Bulk items

	- Collection points

	- Terms & condition

:::note
Only **Admin, Inbox Admin & Inbox Supervisor** can create, read, update and delete content in the knowledge base. 
**Inbox Agents** can only read articles.
