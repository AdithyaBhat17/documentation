### Working hours

Working  hours refer to the actual working hours of your customer support team. It refers to the time duration your agents would be available to take live chats and solve customer queries.

When you have set working hours for your team say 9 AM - 5 PM and when a customer reaches out at 6 PM, they’ll not be able to connect to an agent because a ticket would not be created. Now you can display an automated message to the customer which explains the situation why they are not able to connect to the live agents, for a better user experience.
  
This customizable automated message is called **Away message** which would be displayed when a customer is trying to reach out to a live agent outside their working hours.

*An example for an Away message can be - No agents are available right now. Our working hours are from 10 AM to 7 PM; Monday to Saturday, except for National and Public Holidays.*

Note that you can still capture the incoming tickets outside working hours by enabling **offline chats** which will record all the tickets and auto-assign them to agents who appear online. 

You can specify unique working hours for each day of the week. You can also set different working hours for each of your groups.

#### How to set working hours?:
- Enable working hours
> **Go to Inbox -> Chats - > Settings - > Agent configuration -> Working hours page. Here you’d find all your groups.**

- You’ll have to select the timezone of your workforce through this setting. This applies to all the groups/agents in this account.

Even when a customer messages from a different timezone, their time would be converted into the timezone that you’ve set above, and only then a ticket is created if it falls within the specified business hours.



### Note:

- If group-specific working hours are not configured, the **default configuration** will be used.

- You can set only **one timezone** for all your groups
    
- Ensure you’ve entered proper timings as this is the base criteria for a ticket to be assigned to a live agent.

- Working hours only affect the logic of **ticket assignment** in the Inbox. Report metrics such as Average handling time, First response time would not be affected by the working hours as they are dependant on how long a ticket is assigned to an agent.  
*Eg: 
You have set business hours as 9 AM - 5 PM on Mon - Fri. If a ticket is assigned to an agent on Friday, 4.45 pm, and the ticket was only resolved by the agent at 9.15 am on Monday. Then the handling time for that particular ticket would be 3870 mins and not 30 mins*
