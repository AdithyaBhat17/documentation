Tags are labels that you assign to conversations after the end or during the chat sessions and one of the best ways to organize conversations and for quicker follow-ups. They are typically used to categorize and organize all customer communication and to escalate it to the right team for further actions fast and effectively.

Tagging your chats helps you search or filter your chat menu and makes it easier to analyze the chat traffic.

#### Learn how to use tags

Tags are great for both admins and agents. Admins can obtain an overview of chat conversation topics by viewing the 10 most popular tags in a week. Agents can easily tag chats either automatically using Shortcuts, or manually by selecting tags from a predefined list.


To create a new tag:

1. Login to your bot and go to <b>Inbox</b> -> Settings -> <b>Chats configuration</b>

2. Enter a name for the tag. 

3. Save it, by clicking on <b><i>Add</i></b>.



You can select from a list of existing tags and also edit this list by adding and removing tags any time you need.


Tags can be created based for a particular group only. Only issues belonging to that group will see these tags. It’s quite handy as agents only see tags relevant to them, and don’t need to go through a never-ending list to find the correct one.
