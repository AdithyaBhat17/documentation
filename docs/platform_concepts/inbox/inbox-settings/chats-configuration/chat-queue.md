Chat queues help you strike the right balance between wait times and internal resources. They prevent a concurrent chat overload for agents, while keeping your waiting customers updated.

This makes your chat queues easy to manage and customise. With our inbuilt system, you can:

• View all pending chats and their current time in queue

• Set queue rules based on agent availability and customer wait length

• Time and customise the messages your chat users see while waiting

• Create auto-accept rules to direct requests to the least busy operator

• Access queue reports on a daily, weekly and monthly basis

Customers enter queue when your agents' chat limit has been reached. This way they can focus on finishing current chats before starting new ones. You can change the limit in your agents' profile settings.

This also decides the queue limit for your groups to make sure your customers are handled well.

You can control the number of incoming chat tickets when all the agents are occupied with their existing tickets.


This controlling of tickets consists of 2 options:
* Missed
* Open

#### Missed

This control gives you a list of all the tickets that are missed by the agents when they are occupied.


#### Open

Here, the list consists of all the existing tickets the agents are working on.


There is a default option that can be enabled/disabled where the chats can be marked as <i>Missed</i> if it exceeds the inactivity duration when they are in the queue to be answered to. The duration can be set in minutes accordingly.

The agents can be grouped and named as well according to their teams and departments. There are other options available that can be enabled and the number can be defined based on your preferences.

A save button is provided at the bottom to save all the changes you have made. A pop up window appears everytime you make the configuration changes and save it.
