### Tags


Tags are labels that you assign to conversations at the start, after the end or during the chat sessions and one of the best ways to organize conversations and for quicker follow-ups. They are typically used to categorize and organize all customer communication and to escalate it to the right team for further actions fast and effectively.

Tagging your chats helps you search or filter your chat menu and makes it easier to analyze the chat traffic.


#### Learn how to use tags

Tags are great for both admins and agents. The only way to automatically add tags is in the Studio, where one can pass in a tag at the time of ticket creation using the raise ticket node.


To create a new tag:

1. Login to your bot and go to <b>Inbox</b> -> Settings -> <b>Chats configuration</b>

3. Save it, by clicking on <b><i>Add</i></b>.

You can select from a list of existing tags and also edit this list by adding and removing tags any time you need.


Tags are universal. When created it is visible for all the users - agents, admins, supervisor irrespective of their groups.


#### Reports


This page shows the reports of all the chats handled by the agents, their activity and their performance during their interaction with the users.

### Chats timeout


Based on the agents availability and concurrency, bot will automatically assign tickets to agents if they are eligible. After a set period of inactivity between the agent and the user the chat session will “timeout.” 

This setting is used to inactive the ticket / message, if user doesn’t reply in the given amount of time.

Bot automatically assigns the chat to a user based:

* Availability
* Chat concurrency


Extra points

- First checkbox - A ticket is to be marked as inactive only when the customer is not replying for "x" mins provided that the last message in the conversation is from the agent.

- Second checkbox - A ticket is to be marked as inactive only when the agent is not replying for "x" mins provided that the last message in the conversation is from the customer

- Third checkbox - 

- Fourth checkbox - This feature will come in handy when you don't want to auto close a chat ticket even if it satisfies any of the above inactivity conditions. You'll just have to provide a specific tag to override the default inactivity.




:::info
:information_source: This will not work without enabling the third checkbox - auto close, first.

:::info
:information_source: A default timeout will be applied for channels if user don't specify a unique timeout.

:::success

:bulb: Example: Agent has asked customer to configure/update their account settings and get back. If this exceeds the customer inactivity timer that you've sent but don't want to close this ticket because customer is actually working on implementing the changes suggested by agent, they just have to create a tag, say "waiting on customer" , configure that here and move on to the next ticket. Unless and until that tag is removed from the ticket, the ticket will not auto close due to inactivity

:::


The following are some key features of the chat timeouts which can be customized for different channels as well: 

- Inactivity from customer
- Inactivity from agent
- Auto ticket closure
- Do not close ticket



| Setting | Description |
|:-------- |:--------:|
| Inactivity from customer | This is a built-in setting to automatically timeout a customer if he is inactive for a while. You can check the box and set the duration in minutes).   |
| Inactivity from Agent    | This is a built-in mechanism to automatically timeout an agent if he is inactive for a while. You can check the box and set the duration in minutes). |
| Auto Ticket closure | Checking this box will automatically close the ticket. The default setting will be used if the chat is disabled, deleted or if their is no information from both the sources. |
| Do not close Ticket | This box can be set based on the tags present in the chat. A set of customised tags are available which you can choose from. |


:::info
:information_source: You can also add different channels like WhatsApp, Slack etc and apply the above settings.
A default timeout will be applied for channels where we don't specify a unique timeout.
:::


Since we cater to different channels, we will take a default timeout value for all of them. Incase user wants to follow a different timeout logic for each of their channels, they can add their channel here and enter a different timeout. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/bhXIeZT.png)


Web widget will have shorter timeouts where channels like WhatsApp (since it is a direct channel) can have longer timeouts because even if that customer is inactive for a couple of minutes, they are not completely lost like in web widget. They still have our message in their WhatsApp list and they can always respond back in the same chat.



### Custom Fields


The custom fields setting is used to define and add fields that are required to create, transfer or close tickets. You can create the custom field for the tickets for their respective activities like create, transfer and close tickets.



A custom field is a piece of information that is linked to a customer profile, also known as a contact. There are different types of custom fields that you can collect under a customer profile, for example:

* First Name
* Last name
* E-mail
* Phone number
* Company Name
* Order number

The great thing about this is that you can determine this data yourself. The chatbot can display these custom fields as an invisible input field in a conversation. You can find out how to use these custom fields in the chatbot builder here.

Agents can add, delete or edit custom fields.

Here is a view of the Custom fields at the agent side of the chat.

### What are custom fields?

Custom fields can be added to tickets and are used to track business-specific information related to the customer like Order ID, Address, case details, etc. Custom fields enable your teams to add more information about a case and add further context, which helps with better reporting and to resolve issues faster. Custom fields are available for both chat as well as ticketing modules.

#### Adding a new custom field

You can define a new custom field by going to,
> Inbox -> Chats -> Settings -> Chats configuration -> Custom Fields -> Add custom fields

![Adding custom fields](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/iMY5utFBNX5I1635071973851.png)

There are several different types of custom fields available as shown below:

![Types of custom fields](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/WWLml6pNIMQz1635072064837.png)

Following are the steps to add a new field :

1. Add custom field type
2. Add field name - this is the name that appears in the ticket details page
3. Add placeholder - this is the placeholder text that appears on the input bar in the ticket details page

Following are the types and their examples :

|  Custom field |                          Application                         |
|:-------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Short Text    | Short text like credit card number or order id               |
| Long Text     | Address, Detailed reason for complain, etc                   |
| Keyword       | A single word                                                |
| Tags          | Predefined tags like product category                        |
| Checkbox      | e.g. is this a VIP customer, or was this a sale item?        |
| Radio buttons | It acts like a drop-down list e.g. location, store name, etc |
| Email         | Any email ID                                                 |
| Number        | Any numerical value like an amount                           |
| Phone         | Contact number, e.g. customer’s emergency contact            |
| Date          | Any date value e.g. date of return of the item               |
  
Once added, the field will be listed on the ticket/chat details section on the right sidebar as shown below :
![Example](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/k5VEorRDldSg1635072109945.png)

Only **inbox admin** can create new custom fields.

#### Updating a custom field
Any agent who has access to edit a ticket can update custom fields for that ticket by simply adding the information. Admins can, therefore, update custom fields for all the tickets. Agents can also search by custom field values as seen below (searching by custom field country)
![Custom field search](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/gJqieNE8tqm61635072154648.png)

### Chat disposition with custom fields
You can also mark a custom field as mandatory to create/transfer or close a ticket while creating the custom field. In such cases, the agent can not dispose off the chat without providing a value for the custom field as seen in the example below :
![Chat disposition](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/NQEV68vQU6oF1635072213029.jpg)

### Reporting on custom fields
There is a column dedictaed to each custom field in the chat archives report as shown below
 ![Custom field reports](https://cdn.yellowmessenger.com/5JZOkYaOM9KO1635072241566.jpg)

### Automation on custom fields
Whenever a custom field is updated, we send an event **ticket-update** with changeType **change_custom_field**, you can capture this event in builder using event hub to develop automation flows following custom field updates - *e.g. updating an order in shopify when the order ID custom field is updated in Yellow AI.*





### CSAT Feedback

This setting helps you to measure how happy your customers are with agents and their service. If you want to retain more customers and increase customer lifetime value, it’s essential to keep customer satisfaction high by resolving their queries.

CSAT is important because it helps you solve problems, prevent churn, and identify happy customers that can become your advocates and evangelists. It’s an essential step in the process of building customer loyalty, creating customer delight, areas to excel, improve and generating positive word-of-mouth.

User feedbacks can be found at the Data Explorer section of the Insights module.

Whether it’s through a message, or simply a nice email, always thank the customer for their time, regardless of the nature of the feedback.
