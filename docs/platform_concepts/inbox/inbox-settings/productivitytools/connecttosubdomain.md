Businesses would generally want to host their knowledge base right within their website making it easier for their customers to access.   

> For example, [docs.yellow.ai](https://docs.yellow.ai/) is the official knowledge base for all Yellow.ai products.

Every inbox account comes with a free autogenerated subdomain provided by Yellow.ai where the knowledge base articles will be hosted. It will roughly be in the format of www.<botname/kbname>.yellow.ai.
