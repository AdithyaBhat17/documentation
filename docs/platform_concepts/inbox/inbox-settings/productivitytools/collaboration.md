When agents are auto-assigned to a chat ticket, they may want access to add collaborators to their chat.
With this, the inbox agent and the collaborators (other agents who are invited to this chat) can respond to the customer queries.
Inbox admin has permission based on the business use case to provide this option to the inbox agents.

**Example use case:** 

A company handles queries on footwear and electronic accessories separately by creating two agent groups. If an agent from the footwear team is assigned to handle a chat query about footwear and while the conversation proceeds a question is raised by the customer about accessories and the agent is unaware of the solution, the agent can add a collaborator from the accessories team to this chat. The customer can interact with both agents and get the query resolved.
