**What are canned responses?**

Canned Responses are pre-defined notifications for frequent replies, with which the support reps can reply to emails with ease. Other than a customized template for individual emails, the canned response can be sent to the frequently raised requests. It reduces the response time and also provides a personal touch to the request. The response can be made private or public according to your convenience. You can add, manage and share a canned response.
 
It allows you to:

* Create and manage customizable templates for comments and issue descriptions.
* Add automated actions to templates/chats.
* Quickly insert favorite templates with just one click.


There are two sections of canned responses:
1. **Chat**- Can text Text and Media as a response
2. **Email**- Can have only Text as a response

Based on the requirement, these canned responses can be added or edited. The process to add/delete canned responses for chat and email are the same.
