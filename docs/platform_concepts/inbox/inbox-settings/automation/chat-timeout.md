When the chat system is online, users or agents who click to chat are entered into a queue until an agent accepts the chat request. The conversation starts between the agent and the user once the request is accepted. After a set period of inactivity between the agent and the user the chat session will “timeout.” 

This can be configured in **Inactivity trigger** settings. It is used to inactivate the ticket/message, if user doesn’t reply in the given amount of time.

**Open inactivity trigger settings**

1. Open **Inbox** > **Settings**. 
2. Search and select Inactivity trigger.
