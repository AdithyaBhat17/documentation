title: Inactivity Timeout
sidebar_label : Chat Timeout
---


When the chat system is online, users or agents who click to chat are entered into a queue until an agent accepts the chat request. The conversation starts between the agent and the user once the request is accepted. After a set period of inactivity between the agent and the user the chat session will “timeout.”
