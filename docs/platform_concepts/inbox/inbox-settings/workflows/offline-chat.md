To manage tickets raised after working hours in the offline handling setting section. 

If none of the agents are available to resolve tickets and you want to address the customer requests raised at that time offline chat can be enabled. You can manage the limit and status of the tickets after working hours to provide 24/7 support.
Offline chats uphold the continuum of service that your customers expect. If you have customers around the globe, you can anticipate that they may need support outside of your normal operating hours. Offline handling ensured that the inquiries are acknowledged and customers receive a satisfactory answer until an agent has the opportunity to follow up.
An offline chat is essentially a status update that informs the users that an agent is unavailable to chat. This feature replaces your widget anytime agents are unavailable.
