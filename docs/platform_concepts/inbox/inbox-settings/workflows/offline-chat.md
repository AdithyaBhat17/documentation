Here you can manage limit and status of the tickets after working hours to provide 24/7 support.


Offline chats uphold the continuum of service that your customers expect. And if you have customers across the country or around the globe, you should anticipate that they may need support outside of your normal operating hours. This is a good way to acknowledge inquiries and satisfy customers until an agent has the opportunity to follow up.


An offline chat is essentially a status update that tells users that an agent unavailable to chat. This feature replaces your widget anytime agents are unavailable.
