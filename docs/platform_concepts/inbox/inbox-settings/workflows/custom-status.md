**Purpose of custom status**

On the custom status settings screen, admins can create a custom status for your agents to suit your business operations.
- With this, agents can set their status depending on this availability (from available to busy or other options).
- Customizing your status also helps to provide visibility into what agents are doing on a day-to-day basis.
- Handling high chat volumes and difficult customers while meeting goals can be tiring and stressful, custom status can provide flexibility through these situations.
- Admins can decide the statuses that are beneficial for the agents to effectively handle chats.

  

For example:
If the agent has decided to go for early lunch from 1-2 PM instead of 1.30 - 2.30 PM, 1-1.30 PM can be set as **Lunch** (custom status) by the agent so that the incoming tickets don't get auto assigned within those 30 minutes.
