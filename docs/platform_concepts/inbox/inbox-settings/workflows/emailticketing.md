3. Select **Enable email ticketing**. When this is enabled, the support emails forwarded to the Inbox chats are converted into support tickets. 

> With this, all the emails will be forwarded to the yellow.ai Inbox rather than the actual mailbox and they will automatically be created into tickets.

4. **Configure acknowledgment email**: When an email is received and a support ticket is created in Inbox, an acknowledgment mail can be sent to the customer. This is a standard practice in the support ticketing industry.
    - Enter email **Subject**. 
    - Select **Priority**. 
    - Type the acknowledgement message in email content using ```<div> Content </div>``` tags. 
    - Click **Save**.
