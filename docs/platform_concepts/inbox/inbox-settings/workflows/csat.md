This setting helps you to measure how happy your customers are with agents and their service. If you want to retain more customers and increase customer lifetime value, it’s essential to keep customer satisfaction high by resolving their queries.

CSAT is important because it helps you solve problems, prevent churn, and identify happy customers that can become your advocates and evangelists. It’s an essential step in the process of building customer loyalty, creating customer delight, areas to excel, improve and generating positive word-of-mouth.

User feedbacks can be found at the Data Explorer section of the Insights module.
