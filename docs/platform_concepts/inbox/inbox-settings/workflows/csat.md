CSAT (Customer satisfaction) score is a numerical measure of customer satisfaction. 

This setting helps you to measure how happy your customers are with agents and their service. If you want to retain more customers and increase customer lifetime value, it’s essential to keep customer satisfaction high by resolving their queries. CSAT helps you solve problems, prevent churn, and identify happy customers that can become your advocates and evangelists. It’s an essential step in the process of building customer loyalty, creating customer delight, and areas to excel, improve, and generate positive word-of-mouth.


- When the agent clicks **Resolve** after the chat is resolved, the user gets a message to rate the agent and the interaction when this feature is enabled on the Customer satisfaction set.
