## <a name="1"></a> 1. Custom field in chat details

You can find the custom fields in the chat details. These are customized fields created by the admin to obtain additional details of the ticket based on the industry. 
Custom fields are necessary for the agent/admin to Resolve/Transfer any ticket.

**What are custom fields?**

Custom fields can be added to tickets and are used to track business-specific information related to the customer like Order ID, Address, case details, etc. Custom fields enable your teams to add more information about a case and add further context, which helps with better reporting and to resolve issues faster. Custom fields are available for both chats and email (ticketing) modules.

**Access**

- **Inbox Agent** with access to edit that particular ticket will have permission to update these fields in the chat. 
- **Inbox Admins** can update/create custom fields for all the tickets. Agents can also search by custom field values (for example: searching by custom field **Country**)

## <a name="4"></a>  4. Automation on custom fields

When a custom field is updated, the app sends an event **ticket-update** with changeType **change_custom_field**, you can capture this event in Builder/Studio on [Event Hub](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/events/event-hub#inb-1) to develop automation flows following custom field updates.
For example: Updating an order in Shopify when the order ID custom field is updated in Yellow AI.
