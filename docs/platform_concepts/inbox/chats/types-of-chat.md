|No.| Type | Description |
|------| -------- | -------- |
|1|   **My Chats**   | If you are an Inbox agent and your status is available, the ticket raised and assigned to you will be displayed under **My chats**. **My chats** will differ from agent to agent because they can only see the tickets assigned to them.     |
|2|**Queued Chats**|If the chat concurrency for each of the agents is full, the ticket raised after that will be found under queued chats (only if **chat queues** are enabled). For example, a limit is set that each agent can handle 5 tickets and there are 2 agents. 10 tickets are raised and they are in the assigned state.  In this case, when an 11th ticket is raised and the chat queues are enabled, it will be queued and found under queued chats.|
|3|**Open Chats**| When **offline ticketing** is enabled, a ticket raised outside working hours is configured, and it will be found under open chats.|
|4|**Missed Chats**|When any **raise ticket action fails** due to inbox settings that can be controlled (for example, if offline ticketing is disabled, group queue is not configured, etc.), the chat will be available in missed chats.|
|5|**Resolved Chats**|All the tickets that are solved or **closed** by the agents will be found under resolved chats.|
|6|**Active Chats**|This chat option will be available only to the users who are inbox **Supervisor/Admin** (Overall), where they can see all the active tickets that are being handled by the agents.|
|7|**Bot Messages**|All the conversations that happen on the bot will be seen here.|
