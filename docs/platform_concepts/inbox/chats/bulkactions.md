### Reopen selected live chats 
 
:::note
Reopening an old chat will create a new chat (with new chat ID).     
:::

As a Inbox admin, to Reopen a chat(s):
- Mark **priority** as Low/Medium/High (Default=high).
- Select the required **group/agent**. By default, the value in this field is Automatic, which means as soon as the chat is reopened, it will be assigned to the next available agent irrespective of the group or any defined logic. 
- Add **tags** if required and add a **description** (mandatory). 
- Click **Reopen**.
