- Deep dive into the total number of chat tickets that are **Assigned**, **Resolved**, **Missed**, and **Queued** on different date ranges.
- Understand the **Average first response time**, **Average handling time** for chat tickets, **Average wait time** a customer has to wait before the connection is made to the live agent, **Average reply time** an agent takes to reply back to the end users conversation. 

This can be tracked for specified date ranges or custom date ranges. 

**Live chats**

Example: For each of the **Chat ticket numbers**, you can see the **Agent name** for whom the ticket is assigned to with the **Priority**, **Assigned time** (at what time the chat was assigned), **Duration** (for how long the chat is going on), **Reply count** (how many replies have been sent to the user), etc.
