### Difference between KB and v1.Doc Cog

When a user requests a specific piece of information, **v1.Doc cog**  retrieves only the information from its source, whereas in **Zero Setup**, the bot not only provides the answer to the query but also offers a summarized version of the information.

Make sure you enable **Enable summarised results** for the summarisation.
