## 1. Introduction

Conversation Logs contain interactions of the user with your bot and responses the user received from the bot.  It monitors your bot conversations and automatically tags problematic conversations.  

It helps you better analyze drop-offs, understand user perceptions, and optimise your flows accordingly. For example, you can review conversations to understand if your users are interacting with your bot as intended. It also enhances online chat with a persistent record of information exchanged and decisions reached.



### 1.1 Session

The Yellow.ai platform considers each conversation with a user as a session. Each user has a unique ID called a UID. For each UID, a conversation log is created for all sessions to analyse the complete context. Some logs hold data of upto 5 days of conversations and sometimes there are 3 logs for the conversation with one user.

See the session for each app in the following table -

App | Session Duration
--- | ----------------
Web app | 30 minutes
Whatsapp | 24 hours

### 1.2 Key features

The following are some key features of the Yellow AIâ€™s Conversation Logs:

* ***Auto-tagging of conversations***:
    There are several predefined tags created based on certain rules. The system tries to identify if there is any problem in a conversation and associates a relevant tag. For example, Long response time, Missing bot response time, Abuse, Unused quick replies, Fallback time exceeded, Human takeover, and unidentified. A conversation can have more than one tag.

    You can make use of quick labeling to easily categorize conversations and provide better context to it.

* ***Filter conversations***:
    This makes your life easy when there are too many conversations in the log. You can choose to see specific types of conversations using the various predefined filters. For example, see conversations having a specific journey,  logged on a specific date range, involving specific nodes, drop-offs. and more.

Now that there are many conversations logged in the system, it becomes easy for you to choose specific conversation(s) using the filters and flags available.

To fix a problem or optimize your bot - 

1. Navigate to the desired conversation and click on it to see the entire conversation. You can see at what interaction the issue was identified (auto-tagging).

Consider the following example where the system has identified *Long response time* during the interaction with the user. Go back to your flow, identify the reason, and make the necessary changes. Test the bot to see if your intended changes are reflecting.
