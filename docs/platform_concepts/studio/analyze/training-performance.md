Training performance refers to how well the chatbot has been trained to understand and respond to user input in a conversational context. It is typically evaluated by testing the bot's ability to generate accurate and relevant responses to a set of input that it has not seen before. 

## 1.Access Training performance

To access **Training performance** in your yellow.ai bot:


1.  Go to **Studio** > **Analysis** > **Training performance**.

2. Click on a message to see the entire conversation in which it was used. **Messages** display the unidentified utterances of the bot. You can map these utterances to intents by clicking the dropdown right next to them.

## 2. Filter messages

You can set the **Date** and [Confidence range](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/tools#211-response-parameters) filters to display utterances based on this criteria. If the **Confidence Range** is 1, all the messages would be displayed, if it is .85, only the unidentified utterances would be displayed.

Under [Small talk](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/train/smalltalk), enable **Hide out of domain** to keep gibberish messages(or messages that doesn't mean anything) out of this list.
