**Steps can be seen as building blocks of a Journeys**. 

## Building Journey using 'Steps'
A journey is usually built up using series of smaller steps. Each Journey should have minimum of two steps configured.

* First step always is a **`Start Trigger`**. Start trigger - as we have discussed in previous section - a step that let's you configure what all can make this journey trigger - Intents, Entities, Events etc. 
* Then there are **Interactive/conversational** steps - **Messages** (One way - Do not wait for user input) and **Prompts** (Like question, wait for user input). [Expand](./steps/prompts-and-messages)
* These steps can also be connected to **Action Nodes** to perform some background action like Database Insert, Search, or executing an API etc or some **Logic** like If-else. [Expand](./steps/action-nodes-and-logic)
