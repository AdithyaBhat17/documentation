NLU deals with training machines to read and converse in any human language. Making AI Models understand nuances of language is very complex problem. Thankfully, using Linguistic Semantics i.e. by creating a structured format of sentences, models are able to percieve natural language with good accuracy.

> Note - 
 - **Linguistic** : study of language
 - **Semantics** : study of the meaning of words, phrases or sentences i.e. how arranging group of words in particular fashion to derive meaning.

Question is - how does knowledge of word meanings or sentence formation help in better training AI Models?

Fortunately, solution is easy to gauge by learning about a few key concepts - **Intents**, **Entities** and **Context**.

Any sentence can be broken down into smaller components -

**Intents** - These are the literal meanings or core objective of any sentence like in the above example it is booking a flight.

**Entities** - These are facts or additional information that adds meaning to sentence, for example Delhi, New York and 11th August.

**Context** - In a day-to-day conversation, this generally refers to the underlying meaning of previous few exchanges. For Example - if a person is asking repeated questions about a product and says "Buy IT" , the IT here refers to the product.
