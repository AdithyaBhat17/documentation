For simple & hassle-free management of bots across development environments, publish flow is needed. There are two modes in yellow.ai Conversational Studio - one for making all the changes (*Development Mode*) and one where all end users are interacting with the bot(*Live Mode*).

### Development Mode 

- This is meant for all the on going developments(new journeys/functions, etc) and testing them. Once all changes are working as expected, a request to Publish can be created. Publish request is approved by bot admins. Following video highlights how to create a publish request.

### Live Mode 

- This is the equivalent of production environment where all the end users are interacting with the bot. This is a READ ONLY mode for Studio Module, so, no changes can be made. However, analytics of live users can be seen in Growth Module; campaigns can be run via Engagement Module and Agent can utilise Inbox to attend to customer queries. 

### Publish Request Condition Checklist

- Only super admins and approvers can approve the publish request.
- First ever bot publish request has to be approved by the super admins only.
- Publish requests as a dev can only be seen if you have "Approvers" access to the bot. 
- Only super admin of your subscription/bot can give you approver access.
