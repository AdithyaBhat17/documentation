For simple & hassle-free management of bots across development environments, publish flow is needed. There are should have two modes - one for making all the changes (Development Mode) and one where all end users are interacting with the bot(Live Mode).

### Development Mode 

- This is meant for all the on going changes(new journeys/functions, etc) and testing them. Once all changes are working as expected, a request to Publish can be created. That is approved by bot superadmins. Follwing video shows how to create a publish request.

Admins will receive an email for the same, can review & approve the changes.

### Live Mode 

- This is the equivalent of a production environment where all the end users are interacting with the bot. This is a READ ONLY mode, so, no changes can be made even by superadmins.
