For simple & hassle-free management of bots across development environments, publish flow is needed. There should have two modes - one for making all the changes (Development Mode) and one where all end users are interacting with the bot(Live Mode).

### Development Mode 

- This is meant for all the on going developments(new journeys/functions, etc) and testing them. Once all changes are working as expected, a request to Publish can be created. Publish request is approved by bot admins. Follwing video shows how to create a publish request.

### Live Mode 

- This is the equivalent of a production environment where all the end users are interacting with the bot. This is a READ ONLY mode for Studio Module, so, no changes can be made. Analytics of live users can be seen; campaigns can be run via Engagement Module and Agent can utilise Inbox.
