Small talk responds to casual conversations with the users. This option improves the bot-user experience by answering common questions outside the scope that the bot has generally been trained for.

Example: 

> **User**: What is your name?  
> **Bot**: You can call me Bella.   
> **User**: How are you?  
> **Bot**: I am great! Thanks for asking...  


On Studio there are **default** questions that are trained to handle small talk. You can also add and train your own **custom** questions.
