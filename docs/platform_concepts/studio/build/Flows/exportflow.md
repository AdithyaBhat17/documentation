## <a name="exportflow"></a> 1. Export flow from one bot to another

:::note
- Export flow will work only for bots created after Oct 2021.
- Export flow will work for all the bots irrespective of region. While cloning flows to another bot, source and destination has to be of the same region.

To export flow from one bot to another, follow the given steps:

1. Click **Access Control**.

4. Click  **Test** (Don’t click on “Submit for review”). Click on Test (again) > Select environment as **Staging** and the bot name where the flow needs to be copied. Click on **Import**.
  
:::note 
All the flows tagged to a particular category will also get copied to another bot along with the test flow. Thus, we recommend creating a different category for the flow that needs to be copied to other bots.

5. Check the bot to which the flow is copied. The copied flow is reflected with a red dot.  

:::note 
In case any other flows get copied along with the test flow, this would have happened because all the flows were tagged under a single category and unwanted flows can thus be deleted manually.
