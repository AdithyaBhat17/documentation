### Managing Subscription:

Each user who signs up on cloud.yellow.ai can create their own subscription or is provided a training subscription where they can create a bot and explore the platform.

Whenever another platform user [shares bot access](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/configurations/access-management) with you to collaborate, you have to first accept the invite and then switch to their subscription to access their bot.


1. To switch your subscription, Go to your profile and click on Billing.
