Advanced virtual assistants (VAs) process human inputs to execute tasks, deliver predictions and offer decisions. AVAs are powered by a combination of:More advanced user interfaces (3D graphics and multimodal interfaces: gestures, touch, OCR, etc.) NLP (multi-intent recognition, syntactic and semantic-based methods,and speech synthesis) Deep learning techniques (such as deep neural networks [DNNs], decision support and personalization), as well as contextual and domain specific knowledge. In this manner, advanced VAs assist people with more human-like multiturn conversations and automate more complex tasks.
