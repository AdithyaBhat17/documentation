The ability to turn a request into a query. The relevant information is extracted out of a large knowledge or content repository (or multiple), and presented back to the user as an answer. Similar to knowledge mapping, except there is no manual work to map between intents and where the information is. Knowledge extraction can both be a preprocess â€” where knowledge is ingested and turned into question and answer pairs for internal representation, or it can be done at intervals and even runtime, depending on implementation.
