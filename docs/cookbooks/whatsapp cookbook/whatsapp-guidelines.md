## Procedure for Whatsapp Business Account Setup and Important Guidelines

The first step for businesses to communicate with customers on WhatsApp is to create a Business Profile. WhatsApp will create a unique entry for your business with relevant information that will be visible to customers that are communicating with you.


yellow.ai will create the Whatsapp Business Account on behalf of the Brand. Following are some of the important guidelines to be followed during the setup. 


### A. For Two way communication

Two-way communication, when the user initiates the conversation. 

1. **Accept Whatsapp Account Creation Request on FB Business Account | ETA on client**
Once the FB BM ID is received by us, YM will initiate the process of creating the WhatsApp Business Account on behalf of the Customer and the customer will receive a Request on the `Requests` section of their BM Account. 

Login to BM Account (business.facebook.com) > Business Settings > Requests located in the BM Settings on the left pane > Approve the request from Bitonic Technology Lab.



2. **Business Verification | ETA depends on client and Facebook**
Upon accepting the request Customer has to go to the Business Settings>Security Centre and complete the Business Verification Process to move forward to the next step.  ETA depends on client and facebook (not required if client already has the verification)

3. **Account Status | ETA depends on Whatsapp**
Account status has to be approved. If not approved then the brand should raise a request for the same. Please refer to the above screenshot.



4. **Whatsapp Display Name | ETA 24-48 hrs**
The display name for your whatsapp account. When you add a new phone number to your WhatsApp account in the Facebook Business Manager, you assign it a display name. The display name is required to create a certificate, without which the WhatsApp Business API client will not work. There are certain guidelines and formats that the name should follow. Please go through the details [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/display-name) to make sure that the name you’re choosing for your account is correct and will not get rejected from facebook/ whatsapp.
