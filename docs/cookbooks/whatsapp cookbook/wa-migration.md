**Process:**
1. WABA is created on the destination BSP
2. Acount Review is completed on the destination BSP
3. Source BSP has to disable the 2FA for the WABA in order to allow the destination WABA to initiate the migration.
4. Destiniation BSP will initiate the migration process by sending an OTP to the WhatsApp Number via SMS/Call (Sent from a US Number, its suggested to verify that the incoming services are active for the number)
5. Once the OTP verification is done by the destination BSP the number along with the approved templates will be migrated to the destination WABA.
6. 2FA is enabled on the destination WABA once the Infra is created.
