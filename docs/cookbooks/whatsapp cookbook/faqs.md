# Top FAQs

## 1. Is FB Business verification mandatory?

"FB Business verification is no more a mandate for creating your WA business API account and creating your Whatsapp bot. 

Though there are some limitations of the same, as mentioned : 

After completing Embedded Signup or the “on behalf of” (OBO) onboarding processes, businesses will immediately be able to:

1. Respond to unlimited customer-initiated conversations (24-hour messaging windows)
2. Send business-initiated conversations to 50 unique customers in a rolling 24-hour period
3. Register up to two (2) phone numbers"

## 2. Do I need a number to create a bot on your platform? or When will I need a number? or Can I create a bot without a number?

Yes, you can create a bot on the platform without adding a number and can even test your Whatsapp bot on our test number.
Go to the Whatsapp channel page to find the option to test your bot with the test number.
