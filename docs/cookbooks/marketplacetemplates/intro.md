Yellow.ai marketplace contains more than 100 pre-built bot templates for the most common business use cases to help fast-track building solutions for customers and prospects.  
We introduced this as a one-stop solution to help our customers quickly build conversational agents for them based on their frequently asked use cases (without prior coding or platform knowledge). You can import a fully functioning template that we have built for you with a click of a button. 

We have 100+ templates and components on Marketplace spanning across Ecommerce, Automobile, Healthcare, Ed-tech, BFSI, and Employee Experience verticals. Along with the templates, we have flows which are frequently used reusable components which we have researched and are present across most customer use cases. A prime example of frequently used flows are ‘Chat with an Agent’ or ‘Change Language’. Similarly, you will find a host of flows/templates built around integrations with applications like CRM, Payments, Live Agents, and Marketing Clouds among others.
