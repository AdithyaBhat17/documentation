For all user related questions, you may not need to deploy a live agent to answer all queries. With the FAQs bot, you can automate the process to cover all ranges of topics, where each topic can answer a vast number of questions related to it.


*Use Case definition* - 

In this FAQ bot, we will be covering a scenario where the user may want to understand more on the WhatsApp policies which have been grouped into 3 major topics and further each topic answers their set of questions

*Step 1* - In order to add questions from files and documents, you can now upload the file under Knowledge and extract FAQs from the same. You can then choose to create Journeys from these FAQs.
Here is how you can do this through - Document Cognition.

*Step 2* - You can also choose to add multiple FAQs independently as well.
Here is how you can do this - Add multiple FAQs.

*Step 3* - Incase of queries other than these questions, you can choose to leave a comment and get connected to the Live Agent for support.
Here is how you can set up the - Transfer to Agent Journey.
Next, you can then provide live agent access - Access Control.


*Suggestions* - Set up a Fallback message that can take you to live agent in case the user may have other concerns that are outside the scope of the bot.

*Tips* - Train NLU for all journeys with most commonly used keywords that can trigger the journeys directly rather than following the flow.
