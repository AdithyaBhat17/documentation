**Process:**
1. WABA is created on the Yellow.ai platform using the embeded sign up process and follow the instructructions mentioned in [Create WhatsApp business account](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/channelConfiguration/whatsapp-configuration#11-create-whatsapp-business-account) from steps 1-11.
2. After Step 11, reach out to the customer support team for the further migration process mentioned below.
3. The WABA created will be reviewed by WhatsApp.
4. Then, the support team should configure the following: 
   
   a. Source BSP has to disable the 2FA for the older WABA number to allow the Yellow.ai team to initiate the migration.

   b. Yellow.ai will initiate the migration process by sending an OTP to the WhatsApp number through an SMS/Call (The OTP is sent from a virtual US number. It's suggested to verify that the incoming services are active for the WABA number to receive OTP).

   c. Once the Yellow.ai verifies the OTP, the number along with the approved templates will be migrated to the Yellow.ai platform.

   d. 2FA is re-enabled on the Yellow.ai platform.
