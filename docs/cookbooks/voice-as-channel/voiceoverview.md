Voice bots are becoming increasingly popular as customers seek greater convenience in resolving their queries through voice commands.

Voice bots are automated software programs that can simulate conversations with humans through speech. 
Conversational AI is an AI-powered technology that enables human-like language conversations. It uses natural language processing and machine learning to analyze human speech patterns and generate appropriate responses, understand and interpret user input, and perform simple tasks, all through voice interactions.
