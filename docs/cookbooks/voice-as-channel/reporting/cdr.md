**What is a call details report?**

CDR is a report of telephony data obtained from each call (bot conversation with customer) for reporting and analytics purposes. Parameters of every call made through the **yellow telephony system** is recorded in the CDR, making it a reliable source of truth for call-related information.
- The CDR table contains several fields that record various details about the call, such as **call duration, caller ID, called number, call status, and call type** (discussed in the next section). 
- CDR fields help businesses gain valuable insights into their call center operations and customer interactions.
- By analyzing CDR data, businesses can **identify trends and patterns** in their call center operations, **improve call quality**, **enhance customer experience**, make **data-driven decisions** and **optimize** the voice bot operations for maximum efficiency and effectiveness.
