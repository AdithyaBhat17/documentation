If you're using a voice bot, tracking your metrics is essential for achieving the desired results. Yellow's platform offers comprehensive tracking to give you complete insights into your bot's performance.

You have two options to track your voice data:

1. **Basic Reporting**: The platform automatically tracks common points from the voice conversation and displays them on the Voice Overview Dashboard.
2. **Advanced Reporting**: You can track bot analytics based on your specific needs in the following ways:
    1. View more than 30 voice call parameters on the **Call Details Report** (CDR) in the Data Explorer.
    2. **Design custom flows** to track the specific information you need from the customer, save it in a database, and visualize it.
    3. Use **complex queries** to combine **Call Details Report** (CDR) and **conversational data** and create custom reports.
