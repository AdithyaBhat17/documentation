Yellow.ai offers an advanced reporting feature that allows you to collect and analyze data that may not be available on the call details report or voice dashboard. There are two methods to achieve this.

1. you can collect **conversational data** by creating custom flows that fetch the desired data. This data can then be used to generate reports, visualize the data, and create custom dashboards.

2. For use cases that require both **call details report details and conversational details**, you can create flows to combine both data sources. This way, you can collect data from both sources and analyze it to gain insights.
