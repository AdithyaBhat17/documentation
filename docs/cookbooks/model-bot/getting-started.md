### What is the composition of a virtual assistant ? 
The magic potion contains the following : 
1. An elaborative but short welcome message with buttons to the nearest possible customers requests/features available : **Welcome Message**
2. Things that the bot will understand : **Journeys & FAQs**
3. Things that bot might not understand : **Fallback & Suggestions (Didyoumean)**
In the following guide, we will learn in details what are the best practices for adding the above. 

We can also add other channels and integrations to our bot but we all know the basics have to come first. 

### Use cases  / Features of Model Bot
We have chosen simple use cases which can be used to demonstrate all possible features of the Yellow.AI platform. 

The model bot consists of five journeys : 
1. Change Language : Option to switch between Hindi/English languages
