### 2. Zendesk to Yellow.ai Migration - 
Migrating from Zendesk to yellow.ai's Inbox just got easier with our new migration framework 


### 3. New tab structure in chats- 
We have basically separated the `archives tab` into 6 different tabs for each status to facilitate better navigation instead of cramming everything into one.
