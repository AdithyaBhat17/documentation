## August 2021 Updates
1. Customers will now be able to deep dive into what is going on inside the bot with the help of User Journey Visualisation under Insights section.
Some of the goals that we aim to achieve with User Journey Visualisation :-
- Understand how users are moving inside the bot
- Identify the major points where users are dropping off or changing paths
- Help our customers build hypothesis for what their users are doing and why
- Improve the conversation design (journey & steps structure)
- Improve user engagement & intent completion rate.
