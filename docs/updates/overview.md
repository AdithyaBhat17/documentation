Revert feature is available on “live” environment, it allows the admins to revert to any previously released version in one click.


#### 1.2 Search bar functionality extended for Flows, FAQs, and Intents along with documentation

To avoid scrolling through different sections to find the right flow/FAQ/Intent anymore. **Studio search bar** now supports Flows, FAQs, and Intent Search apart from documentation search that it already supported.

## 3. **Web widgets**

#### 3.1 Storing the response of the Time node in the Date & Time picker, and Time picker cards in GTM format

Previously, user selection was saved in local time which would vary across regions. Currently, the Time node in Date & Time picker, and Time picker cards are saved in GMT to maintain the standard.

> These changes will be affecting the bots which are using the Date and time picker Card and Time Picker Card, not the web view.
