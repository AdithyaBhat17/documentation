For you, our Product & Development team is working hard to consistently improve the product.  
Here is a list of product updates we made in the month of **January** to provide you with the best user experience. 

----

## 1. **Studio**

#### 1. Orchestrator for Cloud Bots

You can now create a family of bots, where one parent bot connects to multiple child bots (only cloud bots are supported) with the following functionalities:
1. **Unify Inbox**: Any ticket created in a child bot shall be redirected to the Inbox of the parent bot. This allows you to handle all the tickets in one place.
2. **Conversation Redirect**: Customers can start conversations with the parent bot, and based on some triggered words that are configurable, the conversation shall be redirected to the respective child bots.
3. **Additional Channel Support**: Connect the parent bot to Viber, Viber Business, FB Messenger, Yellow Messenger, Whatsapp, Google Assistant, Line, and MS Teams.

#### 2. NLU Automated Testing on the cloud 

Bot QA process time is now reduced by up to 30-40% for medium to large complexity bots with the launch of Automated NLU Testing for Intents and FAQs. With this, you can **Generate Utterances** for testing and **Bulk Test** the utterances whether they are getting mapped to the right intent/FAQs.    
[**Learn more here**](https://docs.yellow.ai/docs/platform_concepts/studio/orchestrator).

#### 3. Conversation Designer to design conversations before development 

A simple easy-to-use tool for anyone to design conversations, preview them, and  hand them off for development.
Once your design is done and the preview is approved, open the builder and your designs will automatically get converted into builder nodes, ready for integration. You can also use variables, conditions, and set fallbacks for common validators (Name, Email, and Phone).

> Designer is automatically enabled for all bots created on and after 19th Jan 2023. Contact [anirudh.shenoy@yellow.ai](anirudh.shenoy@yellow.ai) for support.
