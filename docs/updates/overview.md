##### 3. Deflection rate

This is the percentage of sessions handled solely by the bot without transferring to a live agent. It is a measure of chats resolved by self-serve.

:::note
**Human takeover** rate is now replaced with Deflection rate now because it is a better indication of bot performance.

##### 4. User Feedback

A new widget with an aggregate score of Bot CSAT and Agent CSAT on a scale of 1-5, along with percentage increase/decrease in the selected timeframe.
These new additions will help users better analyse bot and agent performance with much more granularity, and without manual calculations anymore.
