For you, our Product & Development team is working hard to consistently improve the product.  
Here are a list of product updates we made in the month of **October** to provide you with the best user experience. 

----
## 1. **Studio** 

#### 1.1 Download API logs data of the last 15 days

> Type - Enhancement


When there is an API issue, it is difficult to understand if our API calls are failing or if the client API is failing. To resolve this issue, we are storing all the API requests and responses to help establish the issues. Click [here](/cookbooks/studio/downloadapilogs.md) to learn more. 


#### 1.2 Bulk Testing of utterances on Cloud

> Type - New feature


To test utterances, the studio QA team had to check each utterance in the bot one by one. This is very time-consuming. To tackle this we have introduced a feature where users can bulk upload the utterances and test which journey/intent they are triggering. Click [here](/cookbooks/studio/regressiontest.md) to learn more.

##### 1. Messages bifurcation

##### 3. Deflection rate

This is the percentage of sessions handled solely by the bot without transferring to a live agent. It is a measure of chats resolved by self-serve.

:::note
**Human takeover** rate is now replaced with Deflection rate now because it is a better indication of bot performance.
:::

##### 4. User Feedback

A new widget with an aggregate score of Bot CSAT and Agent CSAT on a scale of 1-5, along with percentage increase/decrease in the selected timeframe.
These new additions will help users better analyse bot and agent performance with much more granularity, and without manual calculations anymore.

## 5. **Channel** 

#### 5.1 Single/Multi Product message support (Catalog support)  is now available on Cloud 

WhatsApp Product Message Support on Cloud Platform also known as the WhatsApp Catalog Support feature was available on app.ym and now has been made available to be used on Cloud Platform as well. There are two new Nodes that were introduced which will be required to send Product Messages on WhatsApp from the Business Catalogs.

1. **Single Product Message**: This allows you to send a single product on a WhatsApp message with information like an image, description of the product, price, discounted price, etc.
2. **Multi Product Message**: Multi-product message allows you to send an expandable Vertical Carousal message with a maximum of 30 Products for the user to go through and add to the cart or view each product individually as well.
