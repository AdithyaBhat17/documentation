For you, our Product & Development team is working hard to consistently improve the product.  
Here is a list of product updates we made in the month of **January** to provide you with the best user experience.

| *New feature*, only cloud bots are supported.

You can now create a family of bots, where one parent bot connects to multiple child bots with the following functionalities:
1. **Unify Inbox**: Any ticket created in a child bot shall be redirected to the Inbox of the parent bot. This allows you to handle all the tickets in one place.
<!-- 2. **Conversation Redirect**: Customers can start conversations with the parent bot, and based on some triggered words that are configurable, the conversation shall be redirected to the respective child bots.-->
2. **Additional Channel Support**: Connect the parent bot to Viber, Viber Business, FB Messenger, Yellow Messenger, Whatsapp, Google Assistant, Line, and MS Teams.
