## 1. **Insights**


#### 1.1 Bot & Agent metrics added to enhanc data points on the insights dashboard

> Type - Enhancement

To further enrich our out-of-the-box analytics present in the Overview page of Insights, we have added some new and enhanced data points on the dashboard. The 4 enhancements are:

1. **Messages bifurcation**  

Messages metrics under User Traffic is now further bifurcated into:  


| Bot & User | Agent & User |
| -------- | -------- |
| Messages exchanged between bot and user     | Messages exchanged between agent and user     |

|Sessions handled by bot only|Sessions handled by both bot and agent|

3. **Deflection rate**

This is the percentage of sessions handled solely by the bot without transferring to a live agent. It is a measure of chats resolved by self-serve.

:::note
**Human takeover** rate is now replaced with Deflection rate now because it is a better indication of bot performance.

4. **User Feedback**

A new widget with an aggregate score of Bot CSAT and Agent CSAT on a scale of 1-5, along with percentage increase/decrease in the selected timeframe.
These new additions will help users better analyse bot and agent performance with much more granularity, and without manual calculations anymore.
