### 2.1 Enriched channel filter

> Type: Enhancement

To understand user behaviour in much better depth, YellowMessenger channel filter is now divided into -

1. Web - users interacting with bot deployed on websites

2. Mobile - users interacting with bot via mobile apps

Additionally, Yellow API is a new channel introduced for users who only use our backend API to deploy bots with their own in-house UI.

### 2.1 Failure reasons in Notifications report

Introduced a new column, *ERRORMESSAGE*, in the Notifications report of Data Explorer specifying the reasons behind failure of notifications delivery. For example, Recipient number is invalid, the user doesnâ€™t have a WhatsApp account and so on.

There are filters to drill down data that helps understand different reasons for notifications failing, retargeting of those users, plan how to avoid such failures in the future, etc.

### 2.3 Extended session period (24 hrs)

The definition of a session is now updated to user interaction occurring with the bot within a 24-hours window. A single session is considered for any number of interactions the user has within 24 hours from the start of a session. A new session starts after 24 hours. This is to ensure better accuracy in the Sessions data and bring consistency across channels (like WhatsApp).

  

From a billing point of view, irrespective of the number of messages sent in the last 24 hours time frame, only 1 session will be counted for billing purposes.
